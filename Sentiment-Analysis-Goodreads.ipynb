Or embroidered on a pillow — pick your poison.<br/><blockquote>\n",
       " <i> “She realised that she hadn’t tried to end her life because she was miserable, but because she had managed to convince herself that there was no way out of her misery.”</i>\n",
       " </blockquote><br/><b>And these messages have the subtlety of a sledgehammer</b>. Forget the readers figuring it out for themselves — no, the moral and the take-home points will be (didactically) in your face, loud and clear, even if it’s awkward and clunky and stops narration in its tracks. Case in point:<br/><blockquote>\n",
       " <i> “As she switched to freestyle she realised it wasn’t her fault that her parents had never been able to love her the way parents were meant to: without condition.”</i>\n",
       " </blockquote><br/>Some of these platitudes would also feel right at home in the Hallmark holiday special movie:<br/><blockquote>\n",
       " <i> “And … and the thing is … the thing is … what we consider to be the most successful route for us to take, actually isn’t. Because too often our view of success is about some external bullshit idea of achievement – an Olympic medal, the ideal husband, a good salary. And we have all these metrics that we try and reach. When really success isn’t something you measure, and life isn’t a race you can win.”</i>\n",
       " </blockquote><br/><b>And I’m just not big on self-help or motivational books</b>. I find most of them cheesy and corny and really awkward and often so painfully earnest that I just can’t take them seriously. It’s just me - I guess I don’t have the right personality to appreciate them. And so I was not too happy with the turn the story took.<br/>—————<br/><blockquote>\n",
       " <img class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1609823426i/30642686._SX540_.jpg\" width=\"400\"/>\n",
       " </blockquote><br/>The premise was interesting, and the beginning actually had me captivated. It’s a story of a woman who’s had her final straw - a whole bunch of final straws, really - and when gripped by the oppressive darkness of depression decides to commit suicide. <br/><blockquote>\n",
       " <i> “Maybe she was just really crap at it. At life.”<br/><br/>“She wanted to have a purpose, something to give her a reason to exist. But she had nothing.”</i>\n",
       " </blockquote><br/>This may be why so many of even middle-aged people like reading Young Adult books — there’s something quite comforting about seeing a brand-new person, right at the cusp of adulthood, when all the possibilities are still there and no clocks have yet started ticking, and there is enough time and energy to regroup and move on to the road not yet taken. But Nora is thirty-five, an age considered way too late (especially for women, with that damn idea of a biological clock) to not have it all figured out. It’s not the time (at least for women) when the world is considered to be your oyster — <b>it’s the time when you really are expected to have your shit together. And Nora most certainly does not</b>. <i>“Well, don’t hang about. Tick-tock tick-tock”,</i> says a well-meaning stranger in that unasked-for-but-nonetheless-given bit of advice.<br/><blockquote>\n",
       " <i> “When she thought about it – and increasingly she had been thinking about it – Nora was only able to think of herself in terms of the things she wasn’t. The things she hadn’t been able to become. And there really were quite a lot of things she hadn’t become.”</i>\n",
       " </blockquote><br/>In that moment between life and death Nora finds herself in a library full of books that are the alternate lives she could have had — lives that would have stemmed from one different choice, one different decision. (Jo Walton’s quiet gem <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18490637.My_Real_Children\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"My Real Children by Jo Walton\">My Real Children</a> had a similar premise, and it was wonderful). And the point is - once Nora finds a perfect life for herself in this endless tapestry of parallel and “perpendicular” lives, she can choose to stay in it and live it as her own.<br/><br/>The logical place to start is to revisit all those regrets that weigh her down. And Nora has quite a few of those.<br/><blockquote>\n",
       " <i>“Between life and death there is a library,’ she said. ‘And within that library, the shelves go on for ever. Every book provides a chance to try another life you could have lived. To see how things would be different if you had made other choices … Would you have done anything different, if you had the chance to undo your regrets?”</i>\n",
       " </blockquote><br/>And then, after a great beginning (which was not always easy to read given how well Haig was able to capture the snowballing depressing crap happening to Nora) <b>we careen right into the didactic self-help book where each parallel life exists to teach Nora a lesson that sooner or later will be unambiguously spelled out so that we don’t get it wrong.</b><br/><blockquote>\n",
       " <i> “She realised, in that moment, that she was capable of a lot more than she had known.”</i>\n",
       " </blockquote><br/>And if you had any doubts about the ending, doubt no more. It ends exactly like anyone would have predicted at the beginning of that self-help turn, except <b>it’s even more unrealistically saccharine than I even dared to anticipate</b>. It takes a turn into that meaningless “let you be you” drivel that seems to say so much while actually saying very little. It becomes the cotton candy of advice - sweet but of little value.<br/><blockquote>\n",
       " <img class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1609822096i/30642638._SX540_.jpg\" width=\"400\"/>\n",
       " </blockquote><blockquote>\n",
       " <i> “She didn’t need a vineyard or a Californian sunset to be happy. She didn’t even need a large house and the perfect family. She just needed potential. And she was nothing if not potential. She wondered why she had never seen it before.”</i>\n",
       " </blockquote><br/>And all that relentless hammering of the “profound” message into to readers’ psyche interspersed with tired cliches makes the whole book eventually seem bland and repetitive and tedious and, honestly, a bit trite. <br/><blockquote>\n",
       " <i>“I mean, it would have made things a lot easier if we understood there was no way of living that can immunise you against sadness. And that sadness is intrinsically part of the fabric of happiness. You can’t have one without the other.” </i>\n",
       " </blockquote><br/><b>2.5 stars</b>. I did not sign up to read a self-help manual.<br/>But my opinion is decidedly in the minority — maybe I’m just a crusty soulless cynic. Oh well.<br/>————<br/><blockquote>\n",
       " <i>“You don’t have to understand life. You just have to live it.’<br/>Nora shook her head. This was a bit too much for a Philosophy graduate to take.”</i><br/><br/>It’s a bit too much for this science graduate over here, too.</blockquote></span>\n",

I finished this book a few days ago and I haven't been able to stop thinking about it. It has one of my favorite themes or tropes in a book, where we follow a main character who at the beginning of the story is very depressed and possible suicidal and doesn't see the point of life, but then slowly throughout the story begins to build an admiration toward humanity and life. This book was so beautifully written and I love the way this book asks the question: what is the best way to live?<br><br><b>“Between life and death there is a library, and within that library, the shelves go on forever. Every book provides a chance to try another life you could have lived. To see how things would be if you had made other choices… Would you have done anything different, if you had the chance to undo your regrets?”</b><br><br>It's a really cool concept, that between life and death you enter the midnight library, where you get the opportunity to see how your life would've been different had you made different decisions. I think a lot about this, what my life would be like had I made different choices and wondering if I'm the happiest version of myself? This book forces you to ask hard questions, like what makes a life worth living? And are your dreams for yourself really something you want? I love the way this book talks about regrets and how most of the time our regrets are a load of bullshit of things that are out of our control and they are causing a major burden on our life. <br><br><b>“A person was like a city. You couldn't let a few less desirable parts put you off the whole. There may be bits you don't like, a few dodgy side streets and suburbs, but the good stuff makes it worth-while.”</b><br><br>Matt Haig is such a talented writer and there are so many passages and quotes I'm obsessed with in this book. Much like The Humans (one of my all time favorites) this book has you questioning what the point of life is and thinking how truly absurd life can be. But I feel like this book is much more serious than The Humans, there are trigger warnings for depression and suicidal thoughts in this book, and it was very very heavy on my heart to read this book, where as The Humans feels a lot more light-hearted and hilarious. <br><br><b>\n",
       " <blockquote>“It is easy to mourn the lives we aren't living. Easy to wish we'd developed other other talents, said yes to different offers. Easy to wish we'd worked harder, loved better, handled our finances more astutely, been more popular, stayed in the band, gone to Australia, said yes to the coffee or done more bloody yoga. It takes no effort to miss the friends we didn't make and the work we didn't do the people we didn't do and the people we didn't marry and the children we didn't have. It is not difficult to see yourself through the lens of other people, and to wish you were all the different kaleidoscopic versions of you they wanted you to be. It is easy to regret, and keep regretting, ad infinitum, until our time runs out. But it is not lives we regret not living that are the real problem. It is the regret itself. It's the regret that makes us shrivel and wither and feel like our own and other people's worst enemy. We can't tell if any of those other versions would of been better or worse. Those lives are happening, it is true, but you are happening as well, and that is the happening we have to focus on.”</blockquote>\n",

The books of regret. You open one and it transfers you to the life where you didn’t make that particular regret. Was it marrying someone or traveling or maybe other little things.<p><br>While I admit I don’t actively pursue parallel universes kind of books on one hand, and on the other, the main reason why I read this book is that I was choosing the best fiction this year (to vote in the GR awards), I was actually looking forward to it. Most of my friends on GR gave it 5 stars. A book beloved by the majority... I had a high chance of enjoying it. Sadly, I didn’t.</br></p><p><br>First, it was boring. I listened to the audiobook and the narrator wasn’t the best, honestly. Not that her voice was annoying but it was kind of monotone. It certainly didn’t help either that I was listening to <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31434883.Eleanor_Oliphant_Is_Completely_Fine\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"Eleanor Oliphant Is Completely Fine by Gail Honeyman\">Eleanor Oliphant Is Completely Fine</a> at the same time, in which the narrator was so animated reading the book.</br></p><p><br>I also found all of Nora’s revelations and enlightenment typical. Like sure I already know that. The ending was also painfully predictable from the start. So when you can guess where the book is going, everything in between becomes not so interesting anymore, especially if you don’t care about the main character. Unfortunately, I found Nora dull. She wasn’t interesting as the main character and I couldn’t relate nor care about her and empathise with her story. I can’t believe she was this multitalented in fields that aren’t related whatsoever to each other. She could’ve been an athlete, a scholar or a musician. All successful. All based on life decisions. I also think that she had the privilege of choosing such different options. Many don’t. I don’t mean by that the book of regrets but rather focusing on a particular career path from the start. For example, many parents don’t nurture their children’s interests like music or gymnastics for several reasons maybe they can’t afford it or they just don’t care. But Nora had so many options. </br></p><p><br>Luckily, the book was short. I also didn’t hate anything about it, hence the 2-star rating. But at the same time, I can’t name anything I liked. Maybe one of the lives in particular was more intriguing than the rest because of the two characters we met and.. the concept. It didn’t help that the book got repetitive sometimes. The premise was much more promising than the book itself. The “message” was also pretty plain obvious. Yet many liked <i>The Midnight Library</i>, however. So it might be more of a “me and not you” kind of book. </br></p><p><br>But let me tell you this: if you don’t find the parallel universes interesting to read about in stories, don’t read this novel. Don’t be fooled with “LIBRARY. MIDNIGHT LIBRARY. BOOOOOKS.” The library is just more of a metaphor. Most of the events of this book take place in the real world. And unless you’re interested in kind of self-help books (or motivational ones), don’t read this novel either. Because it’s more about what Nora discovered about herself and life, of course, by dealing with/trying to escape from her regrets.<br><br>But then again, the <b>majority</b> liked this book so you might too and it's simply not <i><b>my</b></i> cup of tea. <s>Yet, it <i>was</i> a dreadfully boring.</s></br></br></br></p></span>\n",

       " <span id=\"freeText9547152096891202637\" style=\"display:none\">Okay! No more words! This is one of the best sci-fi dances with fantasy which carries additional philosophic vibes novel of the year! I LOVED IT! ( this is not kind of toasting for the book and raising your glass kind of loving it. This is more like climbing at the top of the roof and declaring your love by shouting and howling to the moon kind of love. If you read the song lyrics of “ Howl” at the book you may probably understand why I feel so enthusiastic and why I’m writing a high volume review!) <br><br/>This book is not only about Nora Seed who is trapped in her life, seeing herself a failure, a disposable human waste who has nothing to achieve, will never be missed by anyone . It’s about regrets, unfinished plans, what ifs, approval of families, drugs, mistakes, giving up, realizing other people’s dreams, self regret, insecurities, self harm, love, passion and hate...<br/><br/>When Nora tries to end her life, she opens her eyes in a library filled with books which contain different versions of her life story. If she finds the right book and most proper life she can live fulfilled and happy, that will mean she can be saved! <br/><br/>Thankfully the librarian Mrs. Elm here for here just like she has done when she was a little girl who recently learned she lost her dad. <br/><br/>Nora could be a swimmer, a rock star, a philosopher, a wife, a traveler, a glaciologist, a mother, winery or local pub owner. She can say “yes” to her ex and accept his offer to live in a small town and own a local pub. Or she can say “yes” to coffee offer of a nice doctor candidate Ash to pursue happiness and love. She can win Olympic medals or she can taste the tempting charm of fame with her songs she writes and performs all around the world. She can be everything or anything. <br/><br/>But after living so much lives, nearly thousand different versions, will she find which is best for her and which life form will suit to catch the real happiness? <br/><br/>Can she live without family members or can she handle losing her friends to death? <br/><br/>What does she really want? What does she expect ? And most importantly will she learn to face the things she regrets the most? Because however she’s ready to start her fresh life with open hands, those clutches of regret always pull her back and prevent her to see what she’s really looking for! <br/><br/>Beautiful, meaningful, dazzling, emotional, heart wrenching, poetic, realistic : these are the words which come to my mind after reading this book. Just like the definition of ideal life. <br/>Sigh...<br/><br/><a href=\"https://niluferozmekik.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">blog</a><br/><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/nilylovestoread/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">instagram</a><br/><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/nilufer.ozmekik\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">facebook</a><br/><a href=\"https://twitter.com/NiluferOzmekik\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">twitter</a></br></span>\n",

His acute observations and experience of his condition informs this exquisite, inspiring, compassionate and empathetic novel where he creates the concept of the midnight library, to be found in the spaces between life and death, to explore life, the issues that afflict our world, through philosophy and more, endeavouring to tease out what might make life worth living and a joy and what gives it meaning. The device used to implement his goal is the ordinary Nora Seed, who has lived her life trying to please others, who has hit rock bottom, suffering the loss of her cat, her job, overwhelmed by the burden of a lifetime of regrets, seeing no light in her life whatsoever. She is tempted by thoughts of suicide that has her ending up at the midnight library.<br/><br/>The midnight library is magical, for a start, the library has a limitless number of books, and these books are far from ordinary, Haig sprinkles gold dust in each book, offering Nora the opportunity to see how her life would have turned out if each and every decision at every point in her life had been different. The books illustrate the endless possibilities that life holds for Nora and all of us. Nora explores each book, with inquisitiveness and curiosity, the widely disparate lives that could have been hers, no easy task as she has to slip into each new life with the complications of being unfamiliar with it and do so without alerting the other people present. It soon becomes clear that there are pros and cons to each book/life, to each decision and choice made, each life containing its own mix of despair, pain and regrets that must be accommodated and handled.<br/><br/>Haig offers a touching narrative that speaks of the joys to be found in living, attained through Nora's eyes as she tries to untangle what really matters in life, putting life in context and perspective with all its ongoing changes, complexities, and an understanding no life is perfect in itself. In some ways, this is a version of It's A Wonderful Life, a favourite film for so many people. What I was so struck by is just how many readers might find this helpful for our lock down times, so many have suffered unbearable losses and illness, have had to face not seeing all those we love and mean so much to us, whilst being weighed down with worries and concerns about how to cope with fears regarding jobs, childcare, money and more. A beautifully nuanced novel that I am sure many will love as much as me. Highly recommended. Many thanks to Canongate for an ARC.</span>\n",

(They are closer to granola bars than cookies, but my favorite in the Chewy Granola Bar Variety Pack was always oatmeal raisin, like a six-year-old grumpy old man, so that's not a negative in my personal lexicon.)<br/><br/>It's just that it could be much better.

The library is full of books, each representing a life she could've had, had she made different choices. Now she has a chance to undo all her numerous regrets and to try out all the lives she's missed out on, to see if there is another one she would like better.<br/><br/>Lest you think I'm cold-hearted for not loving this, I assure you, I'm not. Normally, I love sappy, cheesy, inspirational mush. I watch Hallmark movies. I believe in soulmates and happily ever after. I cry during every sweet scene in every movie. And yet this book left me so cold inside, and I'll try to put into words why.<br/><br/>For one thing, this story doesn't come across as fiction so much as self-help disguised as fiction. The lessons to be learned in here are pretty obvious right from the beginning, yet they are presented like some sort of epiphany that can only be understood if explained slowly and repeatedly. We are forced to endure these lessons over and over every time Nora goes back to the library. Either Nora is the most dim-witted of characters, or the author thinks us readers are.<br/><br/>Another problem is that it's really hard to connect with Nora. She'll take a situation, suck every ounce of joy out of it, and interpret what's left in the most negative way possible. She's full of regret for every decision she's ever made, and thinks the grass is always greener. However, other than being negative, she literally has no other personality traits. She's a blank slate, dull and uninteresting. <br/><br/>I also have issues with the core messages in this book. Nora finally learns her lesson, but only after having fixated on each regret, remade every decision, and lived all subsequent lives. I'm also uncomfortable with the implication that if you're depressed, you only need to change your outlook and you will feel better. That goes against everything we understand about mental illness, including that it's important to seek out professional help, that it can be chemically based, and that it's not a matter of not trying hard enough.<br/><br/>So many readers loved this book, as evidenced by its overwhelmingly favorable reviews. But it's just not for me. This is the second book I've read by Matt Haig, and I've had trouble connecting with both. So I think it's time I part ways with this author and just accept that we are not compatible.</span>\n",

Really, truly.<br/><br/>I struggled to write my summary cause I didn't want to give too much away - so much of my joy of this book comes from just discovering where this story led.<br/><br/>The <b>world-building and the writing</b> were phenomenal. It felt like I was marking a new quote on every page cause so much of it was THAT good.<br/><br/>Nora's character felt so real and she got me all teary so many times. <br/><br/>I loved the <b>ethereal magic of the Midnight Library</b> and the various mind-bending scenarios that Nora went through. All in all - this book was amazing and I could not recommend it more!<br/><br/><blockquote>\n",

The conflict of the book is set by page 38 and the pace increases. I am in constant search of the “Fictive Dream,” where I get buried in the story and the rest of my world falls away. The structure of this book, the constant shifting from life to life gives the story an episodic feel.

As Nora was to discover, we all \"fear life\" to some degree - we learn pretty young that actions can have pretty painful consequences. <br/><br/><img class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1626404559ra/31639909.gif\"/><br/><br/>Some of us stare that fear in the face and do what frightens us anyway. Many more of us, however, will step back and opt to take the safer road. I loved the notion of Nora being able to insert herself in a parallel timeline and see how her life would have been like had she taken a chance on all of those potentially life changing events. The whole parallel universe notion was so tantalizing! Imagine if you, too, could examine and then finally burn your own Book of Regrets and just move on with living your best life now?<br/><br/><img class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1626403547ra/31639896.gif\"/><br/><br/>The first third of this novel is heavily mired in depression. If you've never felt stuck or depressed, you will certainly get a clue of what it feels like after you've read or listened to those first few chapters leading up to Nora's attempted suicide. There was a history of depression in Nora's mother's family. I was not surprised that Nora fell into depression after taking care of her mother during her long, protracted illness. Death has a way of stopping the clock for the survivors and making them examine the value of their own life. I suspect there will be many who will identify with most of what Nora thinks and says in this novel. <br/><br/><img class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1627101271i/31678371.jpg\"/><br/><br/>Nora's Midnight Library is guarded and managed by her beloved childhood mentor and high school librarian, Mrs. Elm. There are several chapters devoted to Mrs. Elm's struggle to get Nora to try to experience one of the parallel lives in her Midnight library. This reflects the very real battle that a person with depression must face to get to the point where they can finally admit that they need help to get \"unstuck.\" Matt Haig has given a whole new meaning to the word \"potential.\" I totally agreed with Nora's final decision at the end of the book. In fact, I saw it coming even before she had completed her first journey. We can't live someone else's life. The choice must truly be our own if we want any abiding sense of fulfillment.<br/><br/><img class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1626403547i/31639897.jpg\"/><br/><br/>This author - this book - has a lot to teach us. I am so very glad that I decided to check out what all the hype was about: turns out, all that hype was fully merited ! Loved every bit of it, including the sad parts. A full five out of five glowing stars for this heart-stirring, sanity-saving novel. We all need to burn our own book of regrets... and just get on with living our best life NOW! <br/>Highly, highly recommended!<br/>Note: I listened to the audiobook version, very ably narrated by the British film actress, Carey Mulligan. <br/>. . . . . . . . .<img class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1626403547ra/31639898.gif\"/><br/><br/>You can check out this and other reviews on my partnered blog: <a href=\"https://crossingthepond.reviews/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">https://crossingthepond.reviews/</a></span>\n",

Every book provides a chance to try another life you could have lived. To see how things would be if you had made other choices . . . Would you have done anything different, if you had the chance to undo your regrets?’</i><br><br>Nora is going through a terrible period in her life, where everything that could possibly go wrong, does. She’s consumed with regret over the paths not taken, wrong decisions made. In the throes of depression, she decides suicide is the answer. She has nothing and no one to live for.<br><br>This is when Nora ends up in the Midnight Library, a sort of limbo between life and death. Part ‘It’s A Wonderful Life’ and part ‘Sliding Doors’, every book in the library represents a parallel universe with a life she could have lived had her choices been different. All she has to do is choose a book and she will automatically be dropped into that life. <br><br>Each time she is dropped into an alternate life, she does so with no prior memory of her life up to that point. She knows she has been dropped in and must wing it and figure out how to fit in seamlessly. There’s a bit of humor when she must google herself and check her social media accounts for clues. In one life she thinks she must have been very happy because she wasn’t very active on social media (ha).<br><br>If she loves a life she has a choice to stay. But if she begins to feel disillusioned, she returns to the library, where an infinite number of possibilities awaits. The problem with infinite possibilities is the thought that something better awaits had a different path been chosen.<br><br>Each decision/life contains unforeseen consequences, some good and some bad. Is the grass always greener? It is easy to imagine there are easier paths, but are there? The problem with regrets is they are rarely based on fact. Understanding the nuances and importance of our lives are not always obvious.<br><br>I won’t ruin the surprise by revealing more of what Nora discovers or decides. It’s much more fun to discover it on your own. While this book could have been predictable or schmaltzy, the author has written a unique, delightful, and thought-provoking story. There are surprises in store and it’s impossible to read without reflecting on your own life choices. This was a terrific choice for a buddy read with my friend Marialyce, and it would be an excellent choice for a book club.<br><br/>I was grateful for the highlighting function on my kindle, as I highlighted a lot. In the midst of a pandemic and social unrest, it’s natural to worry about the future, but this book was a good reminder to make the best of this life we’ve been given.<br/><br/>Knowing the author has struggled with depression and thoughts of suicide made this book all the more meaningful: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/nov/17/matt-haig-i-wanted-to-end-it-all-surviving-and-thriving-is-the-lesson-i-pass-on\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandst...</a><br/><br/>•\tPublication date August 13, 2020.

Nora Seed might seed our mind with melancholy and heart with love in her quest for perfection. Can perfection be attained through the careful movement of the pawns in this deliberate game of life? Through the underlying current of sadness, this literature transcends us to a library between the universes with a librarian who is a mental metaphor that can be fathomed only by a few.<br><br><i><blockquote> “Aisles and aisles of bookshelves, reaching up to the ceiling and branching off from the broad open corridor. Books were everywhere. The shelves really did seem to go on forever, straight and long to the far off horizon. There were no title and names adorning the spines of the books.” </blockquote> </i><br><br>The library between life and death with a vagabond poacher through multiverses, who gave an open invitation to death and didn’t want to be preserved from death as she can’t decide how she wants to live.<br><br/><i><blockquote> “You don’t go to death, but the death comes to you” </blockquote> </i><br/><br/>The fact that the day never ends due to the never-ending light is like living one terminal day. It is exceptionally depressing for an already depressed person who decided to die by traveling with her best companion - solitude from a society so lonely owing to the detachment due to the extreme social media attachment.<br/><br/>Does life seem more attractive in the face of death? Is death the one that makes life beautiful? Is death an obligate parasite that wants to change the relationship to a symbiotic one with life?<br/><br/>Is the simplification of the three-dimensional worlds by humans making it more complicated?<br/><br/><br/><i><blockquote><b> “This is the wrong life. It is really, really, really wrong. Take me back. I do want to avenge. Take me back to the library.<br/><br/>In the cosmic order of things, there is no rejection only redirecrtion.” </b></blockquote> </i><br/><br/>Can a person cry due to sadness, smile due to the speck of light at the end of the tunnel, and be surprised due to the philosophical brilliance at the same time. The reading experience of this book gives us that unique experience.<br/><br/><b>\n",

I felt that the basic concept in both these books is so similar that TJR might say 'MH, you imitated my idea!'. My response would be that the big difference is The Midnight Library is written with and for a purpose. That's exactly what The Midnight Library is about - `a purpose` to save a life by making the person realise the importance of being alive, understand the infinite possibilities, and guiding towards giving a perspective and not taking things for granted. All this is done by staying serious yet funny, with genuineness and not being casual.<br/><br/>The Midnight Library, which can also be named as 'The Many Lives of Nora Seed', explores the many lives of a young woman, Nora Seed, at a time when she has decided to give up her life, and is in fact 'in between life and death'.<br/><br/><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/76360.Matt_Haig\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"Matt Haig\">Matt Haig</a> should consider writing this for the big screen and give it to Christopher Nolan, and Christopher will make a masterpiece out of the script.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/><i>`Every life contains many millions of decisions.

       " <span id=\"freeText16483720082013357175\" style=\"display:none\"><b>Are You Serious, Matt?</b><br/><br/>Could it be true that clinical depression arises from bad choices and disappointments; or is it more likely the other way round? Or is it the case that depression is a consequence of environment, one’s less than sane immediate family perhaps; or possibly genetics, an historical aberration passed down from family far distant in space and time? Is the world an objectively depressing place; or made so by our attitude towards it? The philosopher Schopenhauer thought depression was an heroic human condition and promoted it by writing about it; Freud thought it was an illness and tried to cure it by talking about it.<br/><br/>Haig thinks depression has something to do with regrets, that is, thoughts about what might have been if we had done things differently. And perhaps he has a point. In his view, regrets occur because of alternative histories we fabricate for ourselves in which disappointment with one’s lot is reduced or eliminated because life would be more fulfilling/successful/happy than the life one actually has. Depression, in other words, is a literary phenomenon. It’s a result of the what-if stories. Imaginative, articulate people, therefore, would be particularly susceptible to the condition. There is in fact substantial anecdotal evidence that this might be so (see, for example, <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4155911010\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...</a>)<br/><br/>Based on this essentially linguistic theory of depression, Haig has a suggestion for therapy. At this point he crosses the line from playful fictional speculation to a less than savoury quackery worthy of Ayn Rand and Tim LaHaye. Haig thinks that some down-to-earth horror stories are just the thing to augment the happily-ever-after alternatives in our heads. Re-write the script, he implies, picking up all the tiny contra-indications of bliss because <i>“undoing regrets was really a way of making wishes come true.” </i>Or just remember that people, jobs, relationships, and desires change. Perhaps what was the case about these things when the alternative history was written hadn’t persisted. Or the outcomes remain the same despite different choices. Haig’s point, I suppose, is that things could be worse; that maybe Leibniz had it right: this world could be the best of all possible worlds. Disappointment with one’s regrets as a cure for regrets, and therefore a therapy for disabling, suicidal depression? <br/><br/>Things could be worse!? That’s your therapeutic message? Are you serious, Matt?<br/><br/>Haig even makes a pitch for a sort of group therapy in which those formulating alternatives to the alternatives get together for solace and encouragement. And of course he feels compelled to bring in quantum mechanics to bolster the non-literary reality of simultaneous lives - a cliché I was mightily hoping he might avoid. And the allusion to YHWH as the master of ceremonies (very Leibnizian), in the guise of a benevolent librarian, keeping all the disparate quantum selves in line is pretty cheesy. Ultimately Haig opts for the cheesiest of all criterion for the story one must have about one’s life: authenticity, we must be our realest, bestest, truest self. <i>“Aim to be the truest version of you,” </i>the godly librarian suggests, as if a depressive has a choice in the matter. I think Haig may have been to one too many EST seminars, or at least spent too much time in Southern California reading Heidegger on the beach.<br/><br/>Of course in creating these new personal stories another issue eventually arises if one’s authentic self is the depressed wreck one started with. Then <i>“It is quite a revelation to discover that the place you wanted to escape to is the exact same place you escaped from,” </i>says Haig’s protagonist, brought back from the brink of suicidal death. But the important point, according to Haig, is <i>“You just had to never give up on the idea that there would be a life somewhere that could be enjoyed.” </i>Can one help thinking of Eric Idle’s magnificent rendition of ‘Always Look On The Bright Side Of Life’ in the <i>Life Of Brian</i>? Did I mention cheesy.<br/><br/>I think it clear that <i>The Midnight Library</i> is a grave insult to those suffering from depression. It is a facile, trivial, misdirected, and (did I mention?) cheesy book. Am I entirely off-base in thinking Haig wrote it as a feel-good piece for those who just need a little pat on the back for their recovery from a bout of the blues, or a failed love affair? If not, you’re a louse, Matt.</span>\n",
